# Laverna - note taking web app

Laverna is a JavaScript note-taking web application with a Markdown editor and encryption support.  It's built to be an open source alternative to Evernote.

The application stores all your notes in your browser local storage spaces such as indexedDB or localStorage, which is good for security reasons, because only you have access to them.

**Demo**: https://laverna.cc/ OR http://laverna.github.io/static-laverna

## Features
-----------

* Markdown editor based on Pagedown
* Manage your notes, even when you're offline
* Secure - client side encryption with [SJCL] [1] and AES algorithm
* Synchronizes with cloud storage services. At this time only Dropbox and RemoteStorage are supported
* Three editing modes: distraction free, preview, and normal mode
* WYSIWYG control buttons

* Syntax highlighting
* No registration required

* Keybindings
