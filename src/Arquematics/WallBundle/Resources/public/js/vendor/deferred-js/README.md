	// Create a Deferred and return its Promise
	function asyncEvent(){
		var dfd = new Deferred();
		setTimeout(function(){
			dfd.resolve("hurray");
		}, Math.floor(Math.random()*1500));
		setTimeout(function(){
			dfd.reject("sorry");
		}, Math.floor(Math.random()*1500));
		return dfd.promise();
	}

	// Attach a done and fail handler for the asyncEvent
	Deferred.when(asyncEvent()).then(
		function(status){
			console.log( status+', things are going well' );
		},
		function(status){
			console.log( status+', you fail this time' );
